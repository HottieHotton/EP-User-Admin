# Overview

This is an application which a template of a project that I want to evolve into something more. This application is built upon EasyPost's Python API and Django. This allows the user to search for a shipment, address, or parcel. This also displays details of those objects if they so wish to see that. In the future, I hope to add a feature so that any EP account can view their details as they please without it being tied to one account.
